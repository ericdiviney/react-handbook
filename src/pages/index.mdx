# The React Handbook **⚛🤌**

Modern approaches to architecture and feature development for production-ready React apps. {{ className: 'lead' }}

> The React Handbook is what you need AFTER you've read the official docs. When you've got the basics down - this guide will help you ship more, faster.

## Our Goals

React is a fantastic tool for building UI's and front-end applications. Hundreds of high-quality libraries make the React ecosystem, and React itself is very flexible in many ways.

On the other hand, the flexibility of React forces us (as engineers/architects) to make so many choices.

This guide aims to help React engineers learn what they need to ship their applications.

### "What they need to?"

That's right. Think of this website as a collection of best practices and widely used libraries that you can depend on for your applications.

### Another React course?

This guide isn't meant to be a typical course that you start and finish. It's a reference, a website you bookmark and return to when encountering something in the React ecosystem that you'd like to research more.

You could spend time yourself researching the best React practices on Google, Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, Dev.to, Frontendmasters.com, etc. But that will suck up a lot of your time, and you'll also have to decide for yourself which material is worth studying (what is right and what isn't).

By using this site, you'll spend less time searching the internet for good learning resources and instead spend more time shipping your React applications in a way that will scale.

The recommendations here are opinionated _purposefully_. You can implement only what you see fit for your project and team.
