# React Performance & Optimization

1. Don't optimize too soon
2. Know what to measure 



## What are we measuring

Loading Performance - This is a measure of how fast the content is loaded when a user visits your webpage. Some specific metrics are First Contentful Paint (FCP), Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), TTI (Time to Interactive), and maybe a "Speed Index".

Runtime Performance - This is a measure of how "smooth" your application runs and functions after the initial load. Some specific metrics for this might be "frame rate", "CPU", and "Memory Usage".
