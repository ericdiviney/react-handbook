# React Native Project Standards

There's no reason you can't or shouldn't follow an organization template like we describe on our normal [Project Structure](/project-structure) page.

## Common UX Standards

**Cancellation** - Give your users the ability to "cancel" a touch/gesture right in the middle of it (for example, by dragging their finger away). Read more about gesture best practices [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/gesture-responder-system).

**Stick to Buttons With Visual Feedback** - Various buttons provided by React Native have their own feedback controls which provides visual aid to the user. It is [recommended best practice](https://reactnative.dev/docs/gesture-responder-system) to implement visual feedback for a gesture touch to keep the user informed of action results. Traditionally, this would've been implemented with things like `TouchableOpacity` - but the recommended component to use for future apps would be the [Pressable](https://reactnative.dev/docs/pressable).

## Ecosystem / Packages

A very useful directory for browsing open source packages and functionality you should consider using is the [React Native Directory](https://reactnative.directory/). You can filter by the platform you're deploying to as well.

Furthermore, there will be times you need to use "Native Modules" to interact with device-specific APIs that JavaScript cannot provide. At the time of writing, `Native Modules` and `Native Components` are deprecated and will eventually transfer to the new and improved `Turbo Native Modules` and `Fabric Native Components`. For more info, visit the [Native Modules Intro](https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-modules-intro) from the docs.

## Component Tips

There's nothing particularly unique in React Native that would keep you from implementing the same general project practices we recommend on our [Project Structure](/project-structure#component-format) page. So for organizing your component files and folder structure we do recommend the same approach.

However, there are some particular catches when developing with React-Native, so we'll try to explain those below:

```tsx
// Occasionally you will run into scenarios where Platform-specific code is required.
// You can use the Platform import for these purposes.
import { Platform, StyleSheet } from 'react-native'

// Conditionally apply styles depending on platform of user
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    ...Platform.select({
      ios: {
        // iOS-only styles
      },
      android: {
        // Android-only styles
      },
    }),
  },
})

// or, reference the Platform.OS property directly to conditionally run code in your components
switch (Platform.OS) {
  case 'ios':
  case 'android':
  case 'macos':
  case 'windows':
  case 'web':
}

if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
  // iOS-only
}
```

```jsx
// <SafeViewArea> & <Flatlist> are two critical components you should frequently use

// SafeViewArea - To ensure your views don't get cut off by odd iPhone screen shapes (wrap your View layer in this)
import { SafeAreaView } from 'react-native'

// FlatList - an extremely performant method of rendering list-like components. Uses virtualization under the hood.
import { FlatList } from 'react-native'
```

## Performance & Optimization Tips

With React Native being a leader in producing mobile applications, it is imperative to consider performance caveats and best practices. For more, please refer to the [React Native Performance Overview Docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/performance). Below are some misc tips for optimization.

**Image performance** is a crucial when working with a native application as memory constraints means unoptimized image use could lead to crashes, especially when using static image resources. Here are a number of ways to handle for this.

- [react-native-fast-image package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-fast-image?activeTab=readme) - Provides a `FastImage` component that integrates with the `SDWebImage`(iOS) and `Glide` (Android) objects which, as you guessed, loads images much faster.
- **Proper image Formats** - You may want to consider using formats like PNG or WEBP format for reducing binary size of images for both platforms. This can reduce images to 1/3 of the original size.

**RAM Format** - For iOS, you can produce your application in RAM format for a single indexed file. As [the docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/ram-bundles-inline-requires) state:

> "... This is useful for apps that have a large number of screens which may not ever be opened during a typical usage of the app. Generally it is useful to apps that have large amounts of code that are not needed for a while after startup..."

With use of [Hermes](https://hermesengine.dev/), this is enabled by default.
