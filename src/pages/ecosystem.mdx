# Ecosystem

React boasts a vast ecosystem of open-source libraries, plugins, and features that can help your team rapidly develop UIs and applications.

Generally, to make our list below, the library in question needs to have support and active development/maintenance. The rules are not strict, something like 100K+ weekly downloads on npm and a release within the last 6-12 months.
