# About

The React Handbook is a website primarily maintained by me, [Eric Diviney](https://twitter.com/EricDiviney). I'm a software engineer building things at [Dialexa, an IBM company](https://www.dialexa.com/) (we've been [acquired](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2022-09-22-IBM-Acquires-Dialexa-to-Speed-Digital-Innovation)!).

## The point of this guide

You'll notice there's not a ton of in-depth original content on this website. We mostly just write a summary of a feature/library and then link off-site to the documentation for you to truly go and learn that technology. There's 2 reasons for this:

1. I am not a very good writer/author
2. I don't want to reinvent/rewrite the same great content others have already created. I'd rather just refer you 

I just like pointing people in the right direction.

## How to consume this guide

You can definitely start at the very beginning and simply read through every page start -> end. You'll definitely pick up some things along the way.

But the real use-case I envisioned for this website was as a bookmark for React developers. Most React devs will already know quite a bit of what they need to do their jobs. But when you think to yourself "I need to implement this pretty common feature, and I don't know where to start." this is the place you should start.

Once you've found out what it is you need to learn, you should be leaving this site (probably to go read documentation or a better tutorial or something).

## Why I built this guide

I am far from the best React developer in the world. I'm probably not even the best React developer at the company I work for. I just want to help people learn things about developing web applications.
