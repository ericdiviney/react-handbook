# Styling & UI Libraries

<Note>
  Helpful tip: before using any libraries below, you should check your IDE for
  plugins that might improve the developer experience of using it. For example,
  if you use Tailwind, the [Tailwind
  IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
  plugin (which recommends classnames in the auto-complete dropdown) and the
  [Headwind](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=heybourn.headwind)
  plugin (enforces consistent ordering of classnames in my markup) in Visual
  Studio Code might be useful for your team.
</Note>

## Component Libraries

Most UI libraries will come with a "theme" or global way to configure certain things like colors, fonts, etc. — but in general, the components render with opinionated styles already applied.

If your app is small enough, it may be simpler to reach for a headless solution (more below) and create the critical components in your app than try to overwrite or customize an entire library.

- [MUI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mui/material)
- [Twitter Bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bootstrap)
- [Chakra UI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chakra-ui/react)
- [AntDesign](https://www.npmjs.com/package/antd)
- [Blueprint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blueprintjs/core/)
- [FluentUI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fluentui/react-components)
- [Mantine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mantine/core)
- [pico](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@picocss/pico)

<Note>
  If you need a lot of customization or control over the presentation of the UI,
  you should consider a headless solution.
</Note>

## Headless Component Libraries

- [radix-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@radix-ui/primitive)
- [headless-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@headlessui/react)
- [react-aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/)
- [ariakit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ariakit)

## Recommended Combinations

- [Radix UI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@radix-ui/primitive) + [tailwind](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwindcss)
- [Headless UI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@headlessui/react) + [tailwind](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwindcss)
- [Radix UI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@radix-ui/primitive) + [stitches](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stitches/react)
