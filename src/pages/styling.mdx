# Styling & UI Libraries

<Note>
    Helpful tip: before using any libraries below, you should check your IDE for plugins that might improve the developer experience of using it. For example, if you use Tailwind, the [Tailwind IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) plugin (which recommends classnames in the auto-complete dropdown) and the [Headwind](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=heybourn.headwind) plugin (enforces consistent ordering of classnames in my markup) in Visual Studio Code might be useful for your team.

## Component Libraries

Most UI libraries will come with a "theme" or global way to configure certain things like colors, fonts, etc. â€” but in general, the components render with opinionated styles already applied.

If your app is small enough, it may be simpler to reach for a headless solution (more below) and create the critical components in your app than try to overwrite or customize an entire library.

- [MUI](https://mui.com/)
- [Twitter Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
- [AntDesign](https://ant.design/)
- [Blueprint](https://blueprintjs.com/)
- [FluentUI](https://react.fluentui.dev/?path=/docs/concepts-introduction--page)
- [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/)
- [pico](https://picocss.com/)

<Note>
If you need a lot of customization or control over the presentation of the UI, you should consider a headless solution.
