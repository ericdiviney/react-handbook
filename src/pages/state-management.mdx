# My Approach to State Management in React

In this guide, I explain my overall approach to thinking about state management in React applications. If you have improvements you'd recommend, please feel free to propose changes to this guide so that others may benefit.

## TLDR

If you don't want to read about philosophy behind managing state in an application, feel free to skim my recommendations with the summary below.

1. **Build It As You Go**
    1. Start building your application without introducing a global store, [lifting local state](#first-maximize-local-state) as much as possible along the way
    2. If your app requires data-fetching from an API, bring in [tanstack-query](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tanstack/react-query) (Rest APIs) or [apollo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apollo/client) (GraphQL)
    3. Start with simple contexts for global values/props, and move to [Zustand](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zustand) / [Jotai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jotai) when your state grows large/complicated (these 2 are hook-friendly so they will mix nicely with the other libraries here)
2. **You know you need everything up front**. [RTK (Redux)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reduxjs/toolkit) to the rescue.
    1. [Data-fetching](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview) in components
    2. [Global Stores](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/configureStore) w/ optimized rendering
    3. [Middleware](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/configureStore#middleware)
    4. Large project/team means a need for code consistency
    5. *"There&apos;s too much boilerplate"* is a tired argument that died two years ago, thanks to this library
3. **Other combinations for manageable global state**
    1. Lift local state where possible.
    2. Use one of the following for data-fetching:
        - [tanstack-query](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tanstack/react-query)
        - [apollo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apollo/client)
        - [swr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swr)
    3. Use one of the following for global store:
        - [Contexts](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)
        - [Jotai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jotai) - includes [tanstack-query integration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jotai-tanstack-query) plugin
        - [Zustand](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zustand)

## Term Definitions

Before explaining my approach to State Management, I think it is useful for us to be on the same page regarding certain words. I use the following terms very frequently throughout this guide, defined here so you have an understanding of what I'm referring to.

**State** - A broad term, meaning the general "data" and "info" you keep track of for your application to function correctly

**Client State** - State data that is managed on the client side of 2 networking applications (IE, the browser and a server)

**Server State** - State data that is managed server-side (database, APIs, etc.)

**Local / Local state** - "local state" here means one of two things:
- State data that is local by its use - for example, state that is encompassed in a React component and not available externally of said component (commonly done with useState)
- State data that is *intended* for or that *obviously* should be local (such as the open/closed status of a dropdown menu)

**Global / Global state** - The opposite of "local" (above), "global" means one of two things:
- State data that is global by configuration (regardless of what the state data is representing or if it ideally would be better as local state). If the data has been configured in a way that it's globally accessible in your React component tree without having to pass as props, then it shall be called "global state"
- State data *intended* to be global or state data that should *obviously* be managed globally (trivial examples might be the currently authenticated user, the user-session access token, application theme data like light/dark mode, etc.)

**Store** - The actual "container" or data block holds your state information. A good metaphor might be like a database (in your front end), the source of truth, etc. "State" is a more generic term describing the data you manage, whereas the store is the actual object/memory/container that "holds" that data your application must manage.

**State Manager/Library** - This refers to the individual tool/solution you chose to implement your state management logic (whether it be Context, Redux, or react-query)

## Categories of State In Web Apps

Next, you'll read about the various categories of information and data your application might need to manage. This is crucial because some state-management tools are better suited for different types of state than others. It can be helpful to plan your application features if you have a detailed understanding of the information you will be managing.

If you&apos;re interested in a more detailed definition of each state category below, we recommend reading [The 5 Types of React Application State](https://jamesknelson.com/5-types-react-application-state/). Again, think of these categories as out of your control; this is simply the nature of the web and how the industry has decided to categorize information.

**1. UI state** (other names: "Control State")

Local state is just what it sounds like: state that doesn&apos;t leave your container. "Container" is a pretty generic word, but to give it some definition, it&apos;s typically interchangeable with "component" in React projects. Some examples of what is meant by "local state" are form values, expanded menus or sidebars, opened accordions or modals, etc. One thing about local state is you can typically discard it until the "container" renders again, initiating the state with a default value. Most of the time, you should use native React hooks (useState, useReducer, useContext) to manage this type of state.

**2. Communication state** (other names: "Fetch State", "Async State")

Communication state is less about storing data/responses of processes happening - and more about storing the *status of those processes. In modern apps, the need to deal with complex asynchronous behavior is normal. We need ways to keep our app functional/responsive while things are happening in the background. Storing when processes are loading, complete, or have encountered an error while running is what we are interested in with the "communication" state. Managing this properly allows us to show loading animations, optimistic UIs, feedback, errors, etc., leading to a better user experience. It will be up to you to decide how much of your "communication state" needs to live globally in a store vs. locally in containers like pages or components. Some examples of this type of state could be (loading, complete, or error).

**3. Application state** (other names: "Business Data", "App Data", "Server State")

Data state is the easiest to define of all these types. It&apos;s any data that powers your application! It's all the data the users need to use the application; it usually comes from external applications (like servers, databases, REST APIs, etc.).

This data type can overlap with number 4 below (session state) in small ways. An example might be a user&apos;s profile data. That info could be called both "business" data and "session" data - since the user&apos;s role/permission could limit what they&apos;re allowed to do in the app. Where to draw the line can be blurry, but don&apos;t worry about that for now.

**4. Session state** (other names: "Authentication State")

Session state is all about managing information about the user currently using your application. It should be noted that even though this is sometimes referred to as "Auth State" - sessions can also exist for unauthenticated users of apps/websites (like an unauthenticated user adding things to their shopping cart on an e-commerce website).

**5. Location state** (other names: "URL", "Browser History State", "Navigation State")

Unless you are building a router or doing some very complex work with browser location APIs - managing the location state of your app will typically be handled natively by the browser or a library like react-router. Commonly, the behavior of your application will rely on the URL (like using an id in a URL such as /invoice?id=1234). However, it is very uncommon for you to need to manage the location state yourself. Typically you would let the browser&apos;s native functionality or a solution like react-router manage this state for you. We don&apos;t focus on managing that type of state in this guide.

## Local or Global: You Must Choose

Categorically speaking, ALL state we manage in applications can be written as either "local" or "global" state - a piece of state *becomes* global based on if its exposed to and consumed by the rest of the application (in other components). *None* of the client-state types above (1-5) are inherently local or global. For some, it may seem obvious - a trivial example of this is the UI state - of which you should use React hooks (like useState and useReducer) to manage almost always. Technically you *could* configure some UI state (that commonly should be localized to components) to be in a global store such as Redux. Still, in most applications, there&apos;s no need for that type of state information to be accessible globally.

You, **the developer**, must decide what state data should be local vs. global. The "localness" or "globalness" of any state data your application manages is defined by how it is accessed from other components. More specifically, to finish what we&apos;re saying here:

- If other components (like children) receive state via props, that is local data
- If other components (like siblings or distant relatives) receive the same state data via hooks/functions, that is global data that&apos;s been injected/selected into your component

### The focus of this guide

So now that we&apos;ve introduced you to the various types of state, throughout the rest of this guide we will focus heavily on UI State, Communication State, and Application State (1, 2, and 3 above).

This guide will focus on only those three types because the others (4. Session State and 5. Location state) can readily be solved the vast majority of applications we&apos;ll build without much consideration.

It&apos;s infrequent that you should write a custom location state manager when plenty of better options already exist for managing navigation history (like [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)).

And for session state - there is very little complexity to storing tokens (but some overlap with other session data you can read in [Typical State Decisions You&apos;ll Need to Make](#common-overlap) below), so here's a summary:

In almost all situations regarding React apps that need authentication, we will recommend using access tokens for communicating with APIs, and tokens can be stored easily in localStorage to persist across page refreshes. If you are implementing access tokens that can be [refreshed](https://auth0.com/blog/refresh-tokens-what-are-they-and-when-to-use-them) (as is common today), your session state management will be a little more hands-on, but typically you can reach for an open-source solution to get you pretty far. In many enterprise apps that use SSO solutions or third-party authentication services, you could utilize these libraries to help with managing tokens client-side:

- [okta-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@okta/okta-react)
- [auth0-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@auth0/auth0-react)
- [clerk-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@clerk/clerk-react)

The reason we want to focus less on token management and routing in this guide is that the vast majority of React applications adopt the same general functionality in these two areas.

## Tools for State Management

I am going to describe (in depth) the three different approaches I take to managing state, each listed below:

- React APIs (useState, useReducer, useContext)
- "Smart" Data-fetching libraries (tanstack-query, rtk-query, swr, etc.)
- Global stores (Redux, Zustand, Jotai, etc.)

INFO: Due to a lack of experience with State Machines (like xState), this approach is not covered. I still listed it here to show that other options exist. We are working to add more information to this topic, and if you are interested in helping us, please contact [Eric](https://reacthandbook.dev/team/eric-diviney).

Each approach above helps in different ways by structuring the application state slightly differently. It's even fair to say there&apos;s a decent amount of overlap between each library (in terms of what they are capable of). They each excel at doing particular things, and some have functionality that overlaps with the others (this is not necessarily bad).

Again, these are just tools for managing state. There&apos;s no silver bullet or "always use this library for X requirement". Here are some examples of the overlaps that immediately come to mind:

- React APIs: can handle local state AND global state
    - Ex: useState for a local toggle in a component, useContext for global dependency injection into components throughout your React tree
- Data-fetching libraries: can handle local state AND some global state
    - Ex: using an API endpoint response in only one component (local by definition, because that data is only accessed in one container) or re-using the cached response data from that same API endpoint in another component (globalish now, because it is shared - using the same underlying data for rendering two components without passing that data as children or props)
- Global stores: for handling exclusively global state
    - Ex: The most common use for global stores are when many components need to access the same information. Even if a global store is used (improperly) to manage some local state, it is configured so that the state data is still globally accessible in all other components. The takeaway is that even if the state is only consumed in 1 component, it is set up so that all other components *could* access that if they want to. Disclaimer: managing the "UI/Control" state in a global store is almost never recommended.

Before you decide that your application will need a global store, let&apos;s talk about some practical methods you can apply to keep your state management as minimal as possible.

## First, Maximize Local State

Now that you understand the differences between local and global state - you need to understand how far you can take local state before introducing a global store in your application.

- [Choosing the State Structure](https://react.dev/learn/choosing-the-state-structure) - Advice for how to structure the specific data you will be managing
- [Lifting State](https://react.dev/learn/sharing-state-between-components#lifting-state-up-by-example) - Lifting state to a parent can sometimes alleviate the need for global stores
    - [Update the State of a Sibling Component by Lifting State](https://alexsidorenko.com/blog/react-siblings/)
    - [Avoiding Prop-Drilling by Lifting State](https://alexsidorenko.com/blog/react-prop-drilling-composition/)
- [Extracting State into a Reducer](https://react.dev/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer)
- [State Co-Location](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/application-state-management-with-react) - how co-location can make your app [faster](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/state-colocation-will-make-your-react-app-faster)

## Second, A Global Approach

Start thinking about a global state solution if:

1. If you&apos;re still prop drilling a lot (after trying the above approaches to lifting state) or feel you&apos;re headed in that direction and want to avoid it
2. If you have some type of state/store that lives outside of your React application, but you need to consume it in your React app

## Comparing Global State Approaches

If you&apos;ve realized you need a global state - the next question you need to answer is which approach to take. You have three approaches you can take (in order of complexity):

1. "Smart" Data Fetching (tanstack-query, rtk-query, swr)
2. Contexts (useContext + useReducer)
3. Global Stores (Redux, Recoil, etc.)

**1. "Smart" Data Fetching (tanstack-query, rtk-query, swr)**

Before exploring global stores - you should be aware of a common situation in a lot of apps where people *think they need a global store - but don&apos;t actually. Picture this React app: a dashboard behind authentication with only several routes (pages). One of the routes simply fetches a dataset from an API and renders a bar graph based on that dataset. Then, a second route also fetches some data from an API, but has a `<form />` on the same page that allows the user to update or mutate that data. After the user submits the form, the application should re-fetch the data from the API to have the new data instead of the old stale data the user previously saw.

If you can step back and observe this at a high level… often, this basic CRUD behavior (fetching data, mutating data, then re-fetching data because we know it&apos;s stale now) is the majority of an application&apos;s state.

If you added a few more things like:

- Built-in cache (cache responses locally until you clear it, such as after a mutation when you want to reset the cache)
- API Request De-Duplication (hitting the same "endpoint" in a different component hits the cache instead of the API again)

Now, you have a pretty robust means for managing "globalish" state in a simple CRUD app. The convenient thing about this approach is that you don&apos;t have to configure anything to access the cache from your components. You simply say "I need the data that comes from X endpoint" and the library handles if it needs to come from the cache or hit the API again. Thinking more carefully - the cache is really what makes this a "global" solution without an explicit global store. Or worded differently - the cache IS the global store (a pretty basic version of one). With this approach, you can easily share endpoint response data across components.

***TLDR***: If most of your app state simply reflects your server state and sharing the server API responses between components, "smart" Data Fetching is probably all you need.

But before you&apos;re sure you don&apos;t need a "store" of any kind, ask yourself the following questions:

- Will the data in your React app go for extended periods without the need for re-fetching from the API?
- Will the state/data in your React app likely get out-of-sync with the server state, intentional or not, during regular application usage?
- Will your API / server-state update so frequently that the React app might not necessarily know when the smart caches (like clearing the cache after a mutation in data-fetching libraries) need to be cleared and re-fetched?
- ??? Any other obvious situations???

If you answered "Yes" to any of the questions above, you should consider a centralized global state as a potential solution (Contexts or State Manager).

**2. Contexts (useContext + useReducer)**

The first and more primitive way (no external dependencies) to implement a global store would be with React&apos;s [useContext](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext) hook. Contexts are most useful for avoiding [prop drilling](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context#the-problem-with-passing-props) and managing basic global stores that *don&apos;t frequently change*. A great way to use contexts effectively is to think of them as "hidden props" for your components.

Examined closely, contexts are technically not a state-management solution but a transmission means. It is a form of "dependency injection" for those who know their software design patterns. The actual "management" of the state (storing values, updating values, etc.) is done by the developers implementing state logic with useReducer / useState and then applying useContext in their components to get those state values for rendering.

Summarized: useContext + useReducer can be used for an elementary global store.

Caution: useContext for too large/complex a global store [might](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2021/01/context-redux-differences/#context-and-usereducer) lead to performance issues.

Let&apos;s dig into that a little more. Contexts can lead to performance issues because of how often their updates trigger re-renders. To summarize: when a context provider has any update made to it - ALL consumers of the context must re-render with the new value, even if the particular value (a property inside of a larger object, for example) that was updated isn&apos;t used in each component that will be re-rendered.

Unfortunately, this means when updates are made to the state object from the reducer, each update will cause every context-consuming component to re-render - regardless of which property is changing between renders or not.

From the perspective of the component, assume we have a `user` object consumed from a context. That user object also has a `name` property used to display a "Welcome, [Name]" in a custom component. Every update to this `user` object (regardless of whether the specific `user.name` property is changing or not) will force a re-render of our component.

The limitation with contexts is that you cannot make *precise* updates to particular state values and limit re-renders to the components consuming that same particular state value (like a specific property in your state object). This [article](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2021/01/context-redux-differences/) explains how the popular Redux library alleviates that problem - and you can rest assured that nearly all of the libraries we recommend later in this guide also solve this re-render problem in their implementation so that you don&apos;t have to worry about this.

If you want to learn more about this subject, please read the section below. But if you are not interested in the details of this re-rendering React characteristic, you can skip to the questions below this explanation.

1. This specific problem is why many people recommend using Context for passing props that are "static" values. Static means they rarely change, meaning you&apos;ll rarely encounter this re-rendering phenomenon that can impact performance.
2. Many online tutorials claim that [react.memo](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo) in your components can alleviate this (which is not entirely accurate), but the [react docs](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo#updating-a-memoized-component-using-a-context) clarify this claim. The correct way to use memo() to your advantage is to structure parent components to consume the context and then pass the context values down via props to memo()&apos;d child components (memo() makes the child not re-render if the props don&apos;t change, stopping the recursive re-render process in this child and below it).
3. The only true way to fix this render-performance issue completely while using contexts for all global state is to create an entirely new context for EVERY unique value in your state. For small apps with only a handful (< 15) of values needed globally - this might be fine. But it&apos;s also acceptable to skip the complexity that would be required with this approach and instead use a 3rd party tool as soon as you know you need a global state - especially if you predict that your global state will eventually become larger.

To answer if you need an external global store or if a simple one can work by rolling your own mini-store with useContext + useReducer, ask yourself each of the following:

- Will your app have ***many*** components that need to stay in sync and share state?
- Will your app manage more than ~10-15 state values (**not** objects with nested values) that need to propagate globally to all components in the tree of your app? Answer yes to this question if you easily predict your state will grow to ~15+ values
- Will your app have complex (useReducer becoming hard to manage) asynchronous state logic or very frequent updates to the application state with new data that is then consumed in some way by your React app?
- Will your app consume frontend-app state from any store/source outside of your React app (such as a React app/widget inside a webpage where jQuery can also manipulate the same state of an overall application)?
- Will your state be complex enough that you would want a straightforward way to visualize/debug state updates along a timeline (AKA "time-travel") and how/when updates were being made?
- Will your state need custom logic between dispatching actions and reducers, such as logging, crash reporting, or asynchronous API calls (commonly known as "middleware")
- Are you noticing performance issues due to unnecessary re-rendering from frequent updates to the application state?
- Is your team/project large enough that a more consistent structure/pattern to global state management would help the codebase scale successfully?

If you answered YES to any of the above, you should *absolutely* consider implementing your global state using one of the 3rd party libraries discussed in the next section.

**3. Global Stores (Redux, Jotai, Recoil, etc.)**

The different options you have for global stores in the ecosystem are:

- FLUX Pattern - Redux, Zustand
- Atomic - Recoil, Jotai
- Proxy - MobX, Valtio

| Pattern | Library | Size (unpacked**) | Popularity (weekly downloads) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Flux | [redux-toolkit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reduxjs/toolkit) | 12 MB | 2 million |
| Flux | [zustand](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zustand) | 300 KB | 1.5 million |
| Atomic | [recoil](https://www.npmjs.com/package/recoil) | 2.2 MB | 400k |
| Atomic | [jotai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jotai) | 400 KB | 450k |
| Proxy | [mobx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mobx) | 4 MB | 1 million |
| Proxy | [valtio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/valtio) | 315 KB | 230k |

## FLUX vs. Atomic vs. Proxy

Ok, so we&apos;re moving on from Context to global stores in your application. When implementing global stores, there are 3 popular approaches to managing global application state in React apps. You&apos;ll understand the philosophies of many libraries and contrast them against one another (comparing the tradeoffs of each approach). Ok, so first, the three approaches:

1. Flux - a very popular architecture in the React ecosystem - originally developed by Facebook to address scaling/complexity challenges, it complements React&apos;s unidirectional data flow and enforces strict separation of concerns via concepts such as Stores, Dispatchers, and Actions. Flux also adopts "immutability" as a core tenet.
2. Atomic - this pattern focuses on breaking down the application state into the smallest possible units or "atoms". The idea is that by breaking the state down into very small chunks, components that rely on state values for rendering will performantly only compute a re-render when the "atom" changes. You can also combine atoms to form larger atoms.
3. Proxy - this architecture pattern introduces a proxy object for you to interact with, while that proxy communicates with the source of truth (the store). This approach is intended to make modifying the application state simpler by allowing any assignment/mutation and the proxy forwarding those updates back to the central store (this is the antithesis or opposite of "immutability", really)

So what are the tradeoffs between each architecture? Let&apos;s find out 👇

### FLUX: Immutability & Unidirectional Data-Flow

To understand Flux, you also really need to understand its underlying concept of [immutability](https://medium.com/dailyjs/the-state-of-immutability-169d2cd11310).

A quick example of immutability to jog your memory:

```typescript

// "Mutable" allows this:
variable.property = 'new value';

// "Immutable" would not allow assignments
variable.property = 'new value'; // WRONG!! Cannot change individual properties in a state object

/**
Typically, when working with libs that follow Immutability, you create a *new* object to replace the old object, thus updating the state.

We do that by "spreading" the original state object and then specifying our update inside the reducer function, like below.
*/


// ex. reducer function

(state) => {
  return {
    …state, // spread the original state
    property: 'new value' // overwrite 'property' that was spread in the line above
  }
}

```

There are 2 main reasons I love this concept, if you&apos;re wondering why this extra cognitive overhead is worth it. It comes with good intentions and tradeoffs.

1. Immutability helps enforce "unidirectional" (one-way) data flow, which makes the application state much simpler to debug and understand. There are tools in place to monitor where state changes are coming from (what&apos;s trying to update the state and how) and to ensure only one state update happens at a time (in an orderly fashion), which provides a lot of order and predictability
2. Additionally - there is a huge performance benefit to how this influences the way code is written. For example, in state actions, when returning the original `state` vs returning `{ …state }` with an update - it's because of "object referential equality". In JavaScript, if an object is big enough - trying to deep-compare to determine equality becomes very very slow. It&apos;s much faster to compare if two objects have changed by checking their *references* instead of every single property that exists inside of the objects. This is a fundamental choice that makes state management approaches like Redux (one-way) pretty performant by default because object referential comparisons are very cheap.

### Atomic: Still Flux, but "bottom-up"

Both of the Atomic libraries mentioned in this guide (Recoil and Jotai) take a Flux-like approach to updating state, which makes debugging much simpler when your state starts getting complex. The atomic pattern doesn&apos;t necessarily contradict the Flux pattern described above. But, to differentiate it from Redux or Zustand (the other FLUX libraries we recommend in this guide) and the key reason to pick an Atomic approach, is that your global state data is better described as isolated atoms that require sharing all over your application UI tree. The equivalent of the global store in Redux/Zustand is like having one giant atom of state. If your state data is disjointed, random pieces of information that just happen to be saved together because they&apos;re all global - an *atomic* global state structure might make your application easier to reason about and organize while still keeping the architectural characteristics of immutability and one-way data flow.

### Proxy: Reactivity the right way

Finally, with the proxy architecture, this approach works by exposing a [proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) of the global store, of which the proxy contains some custom behavior like intercepting your assignments/mutations to the object and performing additional actions on the underlying state to complete the activity loop. The Proxy architecture is the most flexible option of the 3 mentioned here - immutability has no authority when using a Proxy and you are free to assign/mutate your state objects in your code however you want.

Vue.js [reactivity concept](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth.html#how-reactivity-works-in-vue) is also built on the Proxy functionality.

Just be aware that the additional flexibility you have updating your application state throughout your codebase could make a detailed analysis of state updates in your application more difficult. You should seriously consider your application's complexity, browser [support](https://caniuse.com/proxy) requirements, and your team&apos;s size/cohesion before moving forward with this for the long term.

## Common Overlap

As we&apos;ve just been through many state solutions - undoubtedly there&apos;s some "overlap" between what they&apos;re able to do. When there&apos;s overlap, it can be confusing as to which direction you should take. There are some recommendations below for questions you'll frequently run into while deciding the best ways to manage application state.

The Overlaps Between Each Approach to Global State

- Contexts / Stores share a very similar approach (avoiding prop-drilling to share data), Stores just tend to have more features out of the box and better options for re-render optimizations
- Stores / Data-Fetching Caches also share a similar approach (sharing the same data between components without props / prop-drilling), the data-fetching solutions just assume all/most client state is simply a reflection of the server state (retrievable via API endpoints)
- All 3 solutions (Contexts, Stores, Data-Fetching) consume data from "somewhere else" and use it for things like rendering, mutations/actions, etc.

Specific common overlaps between "App" State and "Session" State

- Keep things like tokens in localStorage, and the actual data those tokens receive in your contexts/stores. The reason is: the token rarely plays a role in the logic/views of your app. It's usually just included in API requests.
    - INFO: The performant way to store tokens would be to configure your requests globally to use the same API token retrieved from localStorage (just once) instead of constantly retrieving the token from localStorage and then including it in your requests as an HTTP header in each component (this is massive duplication of code and easily avoidable)
- Secondly: should you put "user" info in a store or a context, like a UserContext/AuthContext or something?
    - If the auth is handled by the same system/API that you&apos;re getting your app data from - just throw it all in the store. Arbitrarily mixing contexts with global stores isn&apos;t necessary and could lead to confusing divisions of data
    - If the auth is handled by a 3rd party system like Okta, Clerk, OAuth, etc. you could probably just wrap the user/profile info provided back by those parties in a context (since that data will rarely change) and then keep the rest of your business/app data in stores or caches
