## Does any of this apply to SSR (Next.js / Remix)

In general, this guide applies to managing state on the client (browser). Since the entire premise of SSR is SERVER-side, this guide doesn't really apply to managing any state on the server. To summarize:

- Even apps that use SSR might also need to manage state on the client
- Simple <Resource url='https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/crud-operations-explained/'>CRUD-like</Resource> applications often means you can shift/move some of your client state to the server

## Term Definitions

Before explaining this approach to State Management, let's get on the same page regarding some phrases frequently used.

<Expand parent='State'>
A broad term, meaning the information the application manages &amp; requires to function correctly
</Expand>
<Expand parent='Client State'>
State data that is managed on the client side of 2 networking applications (browser and server)
</Expand>
<Expand parent='Server State'>
State data that is managed server-side (database, APIs, etc.)
</Expand>
<Expand parent='Local / Local state'>
the use of the term "local state" in this guide will fluctuate between two concepts:

- State data that is local by how its used - for example, state that is hidden in a React component and not available externally of said component (commonly done with `useState`)
- State data that is _intended_ for or that _obviously_ should be local (many variations of UI State)
</Expand>
<Expand parent='Global / Global state'>
The opposite of local (above), the use of the term "global state" means one of two things:

- State data that is global by configuration (regardless of what the state data is representing or if it ideally would be better as local state). If the data has been configured in a way that it's globally accessible in your React component tree without having to pass as props, then it shall be called "global state"
- State data _intended_ to be global or state data that should _obviously_ be managed globally (trivial examples might be the currently authenticated user, the user-session access token, application theme data like light/dark mode, etc.)
</Expand>
<Expand parent='Store'>
The actual "container" or object that holds the app-state data. A good metaphor might be like a database (in your front end), the source of truth, etc. "State" is a more generic term describing the data you manage, whereas the store is an object/memory/container that actually holds that data your application must manage.
</Expand>
<Expand parent='State Manager/Library'>
Use of this term refers to the individual tool/solution used to implement some state management logic (whether it be Context, Redux, or react-query)
</Expand>
## Categories of State In Web Apps

Outlined here are the various categories data your application might need to manage. Understanding the disctinction between each is crucial because some state-management tools are better suited for different categories of state data than others.

If you&apos;re interested in a more detailed definition of each state category below, you might take the time to read <Resource url='https://jamesknelson.com/5-types-react-application-state/'>The 5 Types of React Application State</Resource>. Think of these categories as out of your control; this is simply the nature of the web and how the industry has decided to categorize information.

<Expand parent={<>1. UI state <span className='text-[.75rem]'>(other names: "Control State")</span> </>}>
Local state is just what it sounds like: state that doesn&apos;t leave your container. "Container" is a pretty generic word, in React-world it is a synonym for "component". Some examples of what is meant by "local state" are form values, toggle states (true/false) representing expanded sidebars, opened accordions, active tabs, etc. One way to think about local state is you can typically discard it until the "container" renders again, initiating the state with a default value. Most of the time, you should use native React hooks (`useState`, `useReducer`, `useContext`) to manage this type of state.
</Expand>
<Expand parent={<>2. Communication state <span className='text-[.75rem]'>(other names: "Fetch State", "Async State")</span></>}>
Communication state is less about storing data and more about storing the _status_ of processes. In modern apps, we deal with asynchronous functionality constantly (HTTP requests, background tasks running on server, etc.) We need to keep our app responsive while things are happening in the background. Storing when processes are loading, complete, or have encountered an error is the "communication" state we want. Managing this properly allows us to show loading animations, optimistic UIs, feedback, errors, etc., all leading to a better user experience. It will be up to you to decide how much of your "communication state" needs to live globally in a store vs. locally in containers like pages or components. In many applications this is easily solved with "Smart" data-fetching.
</Expand>
<Expand parent={<>3. Application state <span className='text-[.75rem]'>(other names: "Business Data", "App Data", "Server State")</span></>}>
Data state is the easiest to define of all these types. It&apos;s any data that powers your application! It's all the data the users need to use the application; it usually comes from external applications (like servers, databases, REST APIs, etc.). This data type can overlap with number 4 below (session state) in small ways. An example might be a user&apos;s profile data. That info could probably be considered both "business" data and "session" data - where exactly to draw that line can be blurry, but don&apos;t worry about that for now.
</Expand>
<Expand parent={<>4. Session state <span className='text-[.75rem]'>(other names: "Authentication State")</span></>}>
Session state is all about managing information about the user currently using your application. It should be noted that even though this is sometimes referred to as "Auth State" - sessions can also exist for unauthenticated users of apps/websites (like an unauthenticated user adding things to their shopping cart on an e-commerce website).
</Expand>
<Expand parent={<>5. Location state <span className='text-[.75rem]'>(other names: "URL", "Browser History State", "Navigation State")</span></>}>
Unless you are building a router or doing some very complex work with browser location APIs - managing the location state of your app will typically be handled natively by the browser or a library like react-router. Commonly, the behavior of your application will rely on the URL (like using an id in a URL such as /invoice?id=1234). However, it is very uncommon for you to need to manage the location state yourself. Typically you would let the browser&apos;s native functionality or a solution like react-router manage this state for you. We don&apos;t focus on managing that type of state in this guide.
</Expand>
## Local or Global: Developers Choice

Categorically speaking, ALL state we manage in applications can be written as either "local" or "global" state - a piece of state _becomes_ global based on if its exposed and consumed by the rest of the application (in other components) without passing the data as props. _None_ of the types of state we covered above (1-5) are inherently local or global. For some types, it may seem obvious - a trivial example of this is the UI state - of which you should use React hooks (like `useState` and `useReducer`) to manage, almost always. Technically you _could_ configure some UI state to be in a global store such as Redux, but in practice, there&apos;s rarely a need for that type of state data to be accessible globally, and configuring it that way will eventually cause performance issues in your application.

To restate our point: you, **the developer**, must decide what state data should be local vs. global. The trait that defines if a piece of state is local or global is whether the state data is accessed in multiple components without being passed as props.

- If other components (like children) receive state via props, that is local data
- If other components (like siblings or distant relatives) receive the same state data via hooks/functions, that is global data that&apos;s been injected/selected into your component

## The Focus of this Guide Is Not Routing or Sessions

Now that you know all the types of state, the remainder of this guide will focus heavily on UI State, Communication State, and Application State (1, 2, and 3 above).

Those specific 3 types are the focus because the other types (4. Session State and 5. Location state) can easily be solved for us by tapping into the vast React ecosystem without much consideration. Or, put differently, **most apps require the same functionality when it comes to routing and token storage**, so there's not much to solve.

It&apos;s infrequent that you should write a custom location state manager when plenty of better options already exist for managing navigation history (like <Resource url='https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom'>react-router-dom</Resource> or <Resource url='https://reactnavigation.org/'>reactnavigation</Resource> for React-Native apps).

And for session state - there is very little complexity to storing tokens (but some overlap with other session data you can read in the <Resource url='#common-overlaps'>Overlaps</Resource> section below), so here's a summary:

<Details label='More On Authentication'>
In almost all React apps that need authentication - the recommendation is to use access tokens for communicating with APIs, and tokens can be stored easily in localStorage to persist across page refreshes. If you are implementing access tokens that can be <Resource url='https://auth0.com/blog/refresh-tokens-what-are-they-and-when-to-use-them'>refreshed</Resource> (as is common today), your session state management will be a little more hands-on, but typically you can reach for an open-source solution to get you pretty far. In many enterprise apps that use SSO solutions or third-party authentication services, you could utilize these libraries to help with managing tokens client-side:

- <Resource url='https://www.npmjs.com/package/@okta/okta-react'>okta-react</Resource>
- <Resource url='https://www.npmjs.com/package/@auth0/auth0-react'>auth0-react</Resource>
- <Resource url='ttps://www.npmjs.com/package/@clerk/clerk-react'>clerk-react</Resource>
</Details>

## Common Uses of The Tools We Know

There are three primary approaches to managing application state:

- Internal React APIs (`useState`, `useReducer`, `useContext`)
- "Smart" Data-fetching libraries (tanstack-query, rtk-query, swr, etc.)
- Global stores (Redux, Zustand, Jotai, etc.)

Managing state is never as simple as "always use `X` library for `Y` requirement". Below are some quick examples of how each approach can manage state in both localish/globalish ways:

- React APIs: can handle local state AND global state
  - Ex: `useState` for a local toggle in a component, `useContext` for global dependency injection into components throughout your React tree
- Data-fetching libraries: a blend of local &amp; global state
  - Ex: using an API endpoint response in only one component (localish, because that data is only accessed in one container) or re-using the cached response data from that same API endpoint in another component (globalish now, because the data is accessed via a selector, the url, instead of as a prop)
- Global stores: for handling exclusively global state
  - Ex: The most common use for global stores are when many components need to access the same information. Even if a global store is used to manage some UI state (which you shouldn't do), that state data would be configured so that its globally accessible in all other components.

Note there is some overlap above - each can solve local/global state to a degree, some just work better for each than others. Again, it is _your_ choice to make your state data hidden in a component (local) or exposed and accessed in other parts of your React tree (global).

However, developers often do reach for global state manager libraries too soon. There is a balance that we need to get right, otherwise we'll end up with bloated applications. Before reaching for a global state, lets cover the ways we can maximize local state in our React app (both for performance and maintainability).

## Maximize Local State Best-Practices

Now that you understand the differences between local and global state - you need to understand how far you can take local state before introducing a global store in your application.

- <Resource url='https://react.dev/learn/choosing-the-state-structure'>Choosing the State Structure</Resource> - Advice for how to structure the specific data you will be managing
- <Resource url='https://react.dev/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer'>Extracting State into a Reducer</Resource>
- <Resource url='https://react.dev/learn/sharing-state-between-components#lifting-state-up-by-example'>Lifting State</Resource> - Lifting state to a parent can sometimes alleviate the need for global stores
  - <Resource url='https://alexsidorenko.com/blog/react-siblings/'>Update the State of a Sibling Component by Lifting State</Resource>
  - <Resource url='https://alexsidorenko.com/blog/react-prop-drilling-composition/'>Avoiding Prop-Drilling by Lifting State</Resource>

## When Do You Need Global State?

1. If you&apos;re still prop drilling a lot (after trying the above approaches to lifting state) or feel you&apos;re headed in that direction and want to avoid it
2. If you have some type of state/store that lives outside of your React application, but you need to consume it in your React app

If you&apos;ve come this far and now you know you need a global state - the next question is - what are your options? Here are the two popular approaches you can take:

1. Data Fetching & Server Cache (tanstack-query, rtk-query, swr)
2. Global Stores (Redux, Recoil, etc.)

There are times where you might not need an entire state manager. If your global state is relatively small/simple, you might be fine with one of the following instead:

- URL
- Cookie
- Local/Session Storage
- IndexDB

### Why Not Context?

The <Resource url='https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context'>React docs</Resource> explain how to use React Context for more global-like state management. While this can be a suitable solution for simple applications, we find that using Context correctly is typically hard to get right as a global state manager, especially if you have lots of data and its frequently being accessed by various trees/nodes in your application. 

Our upcoming advanced State Management Guide will explain how to use Context correctly, when it's a good choice, and why we think there are <Resource url='https://blog.testdouble.com/posts/2021-03-19-react-context-for-dependency-injection-not-state/'>better options</Resource>. The takeaway here is that an efficient (optimized for re-renders) solution for global state management is not an easy task with Context.

## 1) "Smart" Data Fetching

Before exploring global stores - you should be aware of a common situation in a lot of apps where people \*think they need a global store - but don&apos;t actually. Picture this React app: a dashboard behind authentication with only several routes (pages). One of the routes simply fetches a dataset from an API and renders a bar graph based on that dataset. Then, a second route also fetches some data from an API, but has a `<form />` on the same page that allows the user to update or mutate that data. After the user submits the form, the application should re-fetch the data from the API to have the new data instead of the old stale data the user previously saw.

If you can step back and observe this at a high level… often, this basic <Resource url='https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/crud-operations-explained/'>CRUD</Resource> behavior (fetching data, mutating data, then re-fetching data because we know it&apos;s stale now) is the majority of an application&apos;s state.

The way these data-fetching libraries work to simplify your state manager - is they cache the response of each API endpoint that's getting requests from your app and let you easily re-access the response. The basic idea is when you have multiple components consuming the same endpoint data - the API only gets hit once instead of 3 times (once when each component is rendered) and that response is turned into a global state that gets shared.

The library only needs you to pass the URL string and some options that dictate when the cache should be cleared + refetched. The cache provides you a global store to consume data from in your components, albeit, a pretty simple one that expects all of your data is coming from an API.

**TLDR**: If most of your app state simply reflects your server state and sharing the server API responses between components, "smart" Data Fetching is probably all you need. Here are some additional things that data-fetching libraries also tend to solve:

- Polling on a time interval
- Revalidation on window focus
- Revalidation on network recovery
- Local mutation (Optimistic UI)
- Smart error retrying
- Pagination and scroll position recovery

### When Data-Fetching Isn't Enough

When you're unsure if smart data-fetching will be enough or if you'll need a "store" of some kind, ask yourself the following questions:

- Will the data in your React app go for extended periods without the need for re-fetching from the API?
- Will the state/data in your React app likely get out-of-sync with the server state, intentional or not, during regular application usage?
- Will your application state be updating data frequently enough that its unreasonable for EVERY change to be persisted to the server immediately when they occur?
- Will your server state update frequently enough that your React app might not know when the cache is stale and data should be re-fetched?
- Is it mission-critical that your application shows the latest (uncached) reflection of server state at all times?

If you answered "Yes" to any of the questions above, you should consider a more centralized global state as a potential solution for more complex requirements.

## 2) Global Stores | Singleton vs. Atomic vs. Proxy

The different recommended approaches for global stores are:

1. Singleton - the singleton (AKA "module") architectural approach typically means a single instance of the state (called a "store") that is shared across the entire application. Typically this means one large object that holds ALL state values in your application.
2. Atomic - the atomic pattern (often associated with Recoil &amp; Jotai) all centers around the idea of an "atom" - an isolated piece of state. Atoms are consumed &amp; mutated from anywhere in your application. This pattern differs from the singleton approach above by splitting your state into smaller related groups of data that allow more granular interactions with global state data. Atoms can also be grouped together to derive state.
3. Proxy - this architecture pattern introduces a proxy object for you to interact with, while that proxy communicates with the source of truth (the store). This approach is intended to make modifying the application state simpler by allowing any assignment/mutation and the proxy forwarding those updates back to the central store (this is the antithesis or opposite of "immutability", really)

Next, you can read more about the tradeoffs and benefits each architecture offers 👇

<Expand parent='Singleton / Module'>

Benefits

- Consistency: all state updates being made to the same object ensures a consistent single source of truth
- Middleware: side effects (commonly called "middleware") are simple to implement on a centralized store
- Debugging: debugging a timeline of state updates and events is easy when all updates go through the same process

Tradeoffs

- Once your state-update frequency passes a threshold (~hundreds of changes per minute) this pattern might end up costing you performance
- State trees that become very large can lead to performance issues
- Difficulties in code-splitting

</Expand>

<Expand parent='Atomic'>

Benefits

- Granular Reactivity: since updates can be made to any atom independently, this leads to a very optimized number of re-renders
- Flexibility: atoms allow you to keep your base state as simple as possible and derive any complex state as necessary
- Simplicity: in general, tends to involve less boilerplate/configuration

Tradeoffs

- Experimental: the approach and community is relatively new (compared to others in the ecosystem) - tooling/education might be a little behind that of other architectures
- Lacks "Middleware": The singleton model being so popular for a long time led to the standardization of "middleware" (a big ecosystem benefit)

</Expand>

<Expand parent='Proxy: Simple Reactivity'>

Benefits

- Granular Reactivity: proxies can allow for very accurate observation of state changes to limit the triggering of re-renders where it's not needed
- Simplicity: state updates are as simple as assignments/mutations to any other variables. Updates get magically "synced".
- DX: there's no new syntax/functions to learn. Simply "import" an value/variable and start consuming it (or mutating it). Updates get synced globally.

Tradeoffs

- Experimental: the approach and community is relatively new (compared to others in the ecosystem) - tooling/education might be a little behind that of other architectures
- Blackbox: the proxy can feel a little magical at times, and may prove difficult to debug in very complex scenarios
- Heavily reliant on browser support for the <Resource url='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy'>Proxy</Resource> API

<Details label='What is FLUX?'>
Before diving into the recommendations above, it might help to know what "FLUX" means and why it is included in the descriptions of each library.

The <Resource url='https://medium.com/swlh/the-case-for-flux-379b7d1982c6'>FLUX architecture</Resource> is very intricate with many details, but to sum it up here: `unidirectional (one-way) data-flow, implemented with` <Resource url='https://medium.com/dailyjs/the-state-of-immutability-169d2cd11310'>immutability</Resource>.

Whoa, lots of fancy words there. Let's simplify:

- `unidirectional data-flow` - "actions" get "dispatched" to update the "store" in a <Resource url='https://medium.com/@grover.vinayak0611/what-is-flux-architecture-why-facebook-used-it-and-the-comparison-with-mvc-architecture-49c01ed5d2e1'>predictable, consistent manner</Resource>
- `implemented with immutability` - the way that update operations are performed on the store (the literal code that changes the data when an update happens). Read more about <Resource url='https://wecodetheweb.com/2016/02/12/immutable-javascript-using-es6-and-beyond/'>immutability</Resource> and <Resource url='https://redux.js.org/usage/structuring-reducers/immutable-update-patterns'>update patterns</Resource>

FLUX is just a design pattern for updating stores of data, nothing more. You'll notice that nearly every non-proxy library recommended implements FLUX principles in some way - so its important to understand Flux outside the context of any specific one of these libraries.

## Common Overlaps Between Different State Managers

As we&apos;ve just been through many state solutions - undoubtedly there&apos;s some "overlap" between what they&apos;re able to do. When there&apos;s overlap, it can be confusing as to which direction you should take. There are some recommendations below for questions you'll frequently run into while deciding the best ways to manage application state.

The Overlaps Between Each Approach to Global State

- Contexts / Stores share a very similar approach (avoiding prop-drilling to share data), Stores just tend to have more features out of the box and better options for re-render optimizations
- Stores / Data-Fetching Caches also share a similar approach (sharing the same data between components without props / prop-drilling), the data-fetching solutions just assume all/most client state is simply a reflection of the server state (retrievable via API endpoints)
- All 3 solutions (Contexts, Stores, Data-Fetching) consume data from "somewhere else" and use it for things like rendering, mutations/actions, etc.

Specific common overlaps between "App" State and "Session" State

- Keep things like tokens in localStorage, and the actual data those tokens receive in your contexts/stores. The reason is: the token rarely plays a role in the logic/views of your app. It's usually just included in API requests.
  - The performant way to store tokens would be to configure your requests globally to use the same API token retrieved from localStorage (just once) instead of constantly retrieving the token from localStorage and then including it in your requests as an HTTP header in each component (this is massive duplication of code and easily avoidable)
- Secondly: should you put "user" info in a store or a context, like a UserContext/AuthContext or something?
  - If the auth is handled by the same system/API that you&apos;re getting your app data from - just throw it all in the store. Arbitrarily mixing contexts with global stores isn&apos;t necessary and would be a confusing division of data
  - If the auth is handled by a 3rd party system like Okta, Clerk, OAuth, etc. you could probably just wrap the user/profile info provided back by those parties in a context (since that data will rarely change) and then keep the rest of your business/app data in stores/caches
